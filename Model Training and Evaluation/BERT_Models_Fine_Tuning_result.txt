Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification: ['predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.bias', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification: ['predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.bias', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at model_output_albertv2/winoqueer_gpt_augmentation_trained.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification: ['predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.bias', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification: ['predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.bias', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at albert/albert-base-v2 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing AlbertForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of AlbertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at model_output_albertv2/merged_winoqueer_seegull_gpt_augmentation_trained.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at model_output_distilbert/seegull_gpt_augmentation_trained.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use DistilBertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

If you are using a model from the Hub, consider submitting a PR to adjust these weights and help future users.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification.

All the weights of BertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at model_output_bert/winoqueer_gpt_augmentation_trained.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use BertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

The following columns in the evaluation set don't have a corresponding argument in `BertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: data_name, __index_level_0__, text, group. If data_name, __index_level_0__, text, group are not expected by `BertForSequenceClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
